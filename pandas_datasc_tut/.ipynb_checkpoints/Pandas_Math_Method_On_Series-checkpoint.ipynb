    "- when we have `mutation` problem then we need to go for the `copy` of the `Pandas Series Object` rather than a view of the `DataFrame object` which is by default \n",
    "- when we perform the `math` operation there will not be any mutation problem hence we don't need to `copy` the original Series\n",
    "- `count()` on the `pandas Series object` which provide the `number of not null series values on the pandas Series Object `\n",
    "- if we have a `null pandas Series value or missing values` then it will not be considered \n",
    "- all the `missing or null values` will be ignored in this case\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- `sum()`on the `Pandas Series Object` will return the `sum of all the values in the Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- `mean()` on the `Pandas Series Object` will return the `average of all values in the Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- `product()` on the `Pandas Series object` will return the `product of all values in the Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- The Standard Deviation i.e `std()` on the pandas Series Object `will return the standard deviation from the average value of Pandas Series Object values`\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- we can pass the `Pandas Series Object` to the `min and max` python inbuild method so nthat we can get the `minimum and maximum values`\n",
    "- we cal also use the `min()` on the `Pandas Series Object` which will return the minimum value from `Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- we cal also use the `max()` on the `Pandas Series Object` which will return the maximum value from `Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- we can also call the `median()` `Pandas Series Object` which will return the `medium` Pandas Series Object values when we sort it in either `Ascending or Descending order`\n",
    "- `median` is the `50%` of the Pandas Series Values where `first 50% will fall before` and `rest 50% will fall after`\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- the `mode()` on the pandas Series Object will provide the `mostly occured Pandas Series value` in the Pandas Series Object and return a `Pandas Series Object` \n",
    "- we can also use the `describe()` on the `Pandas Series Object` which will provide another Pandas Series Object `with all the aggregation operation` such as below index and its corresponding value\n",
