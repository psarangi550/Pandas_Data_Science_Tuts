    "# <ins> Copy Method On Pandas Series Object </ins> #\n",
    "\n",
    "- here we will learn about the difference between the `copies vs views`\n",
    "- we can pass an args to the `head()` which will provide the specified number of column from the `beginning of the Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- when we made changes to the `Pandas Series Object` even the `DataFrame object` which being created are also going to be get changed by default\n",
    "- so the `Pandas Series object` and `Pandas DataFrame object` will not be decoupled by default \n",
    "- when we change the `Pandas Series Object` has side effect on the `Pandas DataFrame Object`\n",
    "- when we create the `Pandas Series Object` pandas actually derived the Series from the DataFrame not making a separate copy of it\n",
    "- It basically uses the `Pandas Series` as a view on the `Pandas DataFrame Object` that we created\n",
    "- So we can safely say the `Pandas Series Object` is just a `prospective or view ` over the `Pandas DataFrame object `\n",
    "- when we create the `Pandas Series Object` from the `DataFrame object` it does not come as a separate copy but rather than that it cam e as the linked value\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example :-\n",
    "    - The DataFrame object can be considered as `Big House` but the `Series Object` created from it consider as the `Door`\n",
    "    - by default the `Big House` been linked to the `Door` so we can say `Door` is just a `view or prospective of the Big House`\n",
    "    - when we make changes to our `Door` then We can also impact the `Big House` which is the larger DataSource\n",
    "    - similarly as the Pandas Series object were Derived from the DataFrame and Still has the `link` hence changing that will change the `Pandas Data Frame`\n",
    "    - Hence if we paint the `Door` as red that will have the impact on the `Big House`\n",
    "    - so we need to decouple those if we want to avoid making change to the larger DataFrame object\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- we can avoid that reference by making a separate independent copy of `pandas Series Object` which is not linked to the `DataFrame object`\n",
    "- so that when we made changes to the `Derived Series Object` which is `separate` will not impact the `Pandas DataFrame Object`\n",
    "- we can use the below syntax in order to create the `Separate series` which is not linked to the `DataFrame` its been derived on\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "       import pandas as pd #importing the pandas module in here\n",
    "       df=pd.read_csv(\"datasets/pokemon.csv\",usecols=[\"Pokemon\"])\n",
    "       #creating the DataFrame object from the csv file with only one column\n",
    "       #here we can use the copy() while creating the Series Object from the DataFrame object so that they will not be linked\n",
    "       pokemon_series_data_copy=df.squeeze(\"columns\").copy()\n",
    "       #using the copy() here we are creaing a separate series which is not linked to the DataFrame object\n",
    "       pokemon_series_data_copy #this is the brand new Pandas Series bject and if we are overwriting the value will not impact the DataFrame\n",
    "       pokemon_series_data_copy[0]=\"Whatever\"\n",
    "       #here we are chanign it suing the index position rather than the index label\n",
    "       #now if we see the pandas DataFrame that will strill remain be immune \n",
    "       df #the DataFrame has the Old Value in this case\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "- using the `copy()` on the `Pandas Series Object derived from DataFrame object` we decoupled the `DataFrame to the Newly created Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- by using the `copy()` we clone the `Pandas Series object` which is no way related to the Base `DataFrame object`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# <ins>Summary</ins> #\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Copy` is the `separate clone of the Original DataSource` which will not impact its DataSource if a changes made to the `Cloned Series`\n",
    "- A `View` is a `Prospective` of Larger `DataSource` such as `DataFrame`\n",
    "- if we are making a change in our `view` that will impact the `DataSource` from where its been derived\n",
    "- when making the changes make sure whether thats a view which can iimpact the DataSource or is it a copy of pandas Series object\n",
