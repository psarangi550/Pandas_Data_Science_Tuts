    "    - we can also provide the paramter as `n` which define how many rows of data that we want to see from the `Series` object from the `beginning`\n",

    "    - copies is a `separate copy` of an object\n",
    "    - where as the views `another prospective of an existing object` which does not mean separate object but just a different view of it\n",
    "    - when we perform the `head/tail` method on the existing `pandas Series` we are not creting a new series rather we are zooming into the Same Series which in this case consider as a view\n",
