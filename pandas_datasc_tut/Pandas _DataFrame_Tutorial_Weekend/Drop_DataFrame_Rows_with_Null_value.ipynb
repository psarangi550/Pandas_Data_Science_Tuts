    " # <ins> Extracting a Single Column From Pandas DF object </ins> #\n",
    " \n",
    " #### <ins> 1st Approach </ins>  ####\n",
    " \n",
    " - here we will learn how to `extract or select` a `single column` from the `Pandas DF object`\n",
    " - using the `column header` with the `.` operator we can get the single column value \n",
    " - we can apply the same using the pandas DF object as below \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "         import pandas as pd #importing the pandas moddule in here\n",
    "         df=pd.read_csv(\"<datasets address location>\")\n",
    "         #creating the Pandas DF object from the pandas module in this case\n",
    "         <pandas Series Object>=df.<name of column header>\n",
    "         #the `.` operator with the `column name` provide the `Pandas Series Object` as output\n",
    "     ``` \n",
    "- we can safely say that the `Pandas DF object` is the `combination of Pandas Series Object which are glued together with a common index `\n",
    "- but this is not the ideal approach to fetch the single column value from pandas DF object \n",
    "- But we can access the `column header` as `attribute` of `DF object` in order to get the `single column value in it`\n",
    "- but this syntax will not going to work if the `column header name` has a `space in between them`\n",
    "- it will throw a `invalid syntax` error if  we have `spaces` in the `column header name` in `Pandas Series object`\n",
    "- if we are seaching for the column header which is not present in the DF object then we will endup getting the Attribute Error\n",
    "\n",
    " #### <ins> 2nd Approach </ins>  ####\n",
    " \n",
    " - we can access the `column name` by providing the `<column name>` in the `square bracket` as if we are accessing the `Key` from the `p[ython dictionary`\n",
    " - the syntax of that will be as \n",
    " \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "         import pandas as pd #importing the pandas moddule in here\n",
    "         df=pd.read_csv(\"<datasets address location>\")\n",
    "         #creating the Pandas DF object from the pandas module in this case\n",
    "         <pandas Series Object>=df[\"<column header name>\"]\n",
    "         # the `[\"<column header>\"]` operator with the `column name` provide the `Pandas Series Object` as output\n",
    "     ``` \n",
    "- in case `Pandas Series Object` we are using this approach to get the `Series Value` based on `index lable or index position value`\n",
    "- when we provide the `[]` then it will target the `column of the Pandas DF object` not the `index label of Pandas Series Object`\n",
    "- this also return the `Pandas Serie Object in return same as . operator `\n",
    "- if we are seaching for the `column header` which is not present in the `DF object` then we will endup getting the `Key Error` rather than the `Attribute Error`\n"
